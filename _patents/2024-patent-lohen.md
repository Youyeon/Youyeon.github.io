abstract: >-
  Existing works adopt an eager approximation (EA) strategy to approximate non-arithmetic functions (NAFs), which statically replaces each NAF with a fixed polynomial, locking in computational errors and limiting optimization opportunities. We propose SLOTHE, a lazy approximation (LA) solution that recursively decomposes NAF codes into arithmetic and nonarithmetic sub-functions, selectively approximating only the non-arithmetic components when required.
