  FHE-based neural network inference suffers from substantial overhead due to expensive primitive operations, such as ciphertext rotation and bootstrapping. We focus on optimizing the efficiency of these computations through keyset design. Specifically, we explore three aspects of the keyset design space (KDS) that influence both computational overhead and memory consumption.
