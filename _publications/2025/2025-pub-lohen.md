  When FHE is applied to neural networks (NNs), we have observed that the distinct layered architecture of NN models opens the door for a performance improvement by using layer-wise Ciphertext Configurations (CCs), because a globally chosen CC may not be the best possible CC for every layer individually. This paper introduces LOHEN, a technique crafted to attain high performance of NN inference by enabling to use layer-wise CC efficiently.
