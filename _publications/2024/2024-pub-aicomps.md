  While recent FHE schemes support efficient SIMD-like operations, they require frequent data realignment through rotation, necessitating substantial memory for precomputed rotation keys. We propose an application-aware, memory-efficient rotation keyset generation method that reduces memory consumption, while maintaining similar latency.
